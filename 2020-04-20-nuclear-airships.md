# Nuclear Airships
## 2020-04-20
So, today, after seeing a 
[misc comment on twitter](https://twitter.com/DanTilert/status/1246884451986046976), 
I became fascinated by the idea of nuclear airships.
 
Did a little research, and found
[this article](https://www.navytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/11/30/these-atomic-powered-airships-never-made-it-off-the-drawing-board/) 
about a couple attempts to develop them.
 
In the late 40s and early 50s, Frank Tinsley designed a nuclear powered airship, 
able to launch nuclear missiles, or carry a detachable exhibition hall. Many uses! (Maybe)
 
He took these designs to the US government, as it was a good fit for the "Atoms for Peace" program.
 
However, the US govt instead chose to build the [NS Savannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Savannah), 
which is a nuclear powered merchant ship (i.e. carries cargo and/or passengers).
It was built in the 1950s and it shows in the interior design, which has some 
[beautiful retro 50s aesthetics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Savannah#/media/File:NS_Savannah_entry_lounge_MD14.jpg)

The NS Savannah wasn't very good as a cruise ship or container ship, and got retired in 1971.
It's being decommissioned, the reactor is meant to be coming out around now. 
They started removing it in September 2019. With the current covid-19 lockdown, I wonder if that has been paused.

NS Savannah isn't the only nuclear merchant vessel to have existed.
There have been 4 worldwide, the other 3 were each built by Germany, Japan and Russia (n√©e USSR).

Germany built the [Otto Hahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hahn_(ship)), a cargo ship named for the discoverer of nuclear fission.
It proved too costly to run, and was later switched to diesel.

Japan built the [Mutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Mirai).
Originally designed as a cargo ship, but it never ended up taking cargo.
Plagued with anti-nuclear protests (at port and by fishermen at sea), and a surprisingly leaky reactor.
These proved bad enough that it was converted to diesel and became an oceanographic research vessel, and renamed RV Mirai.

The USSR built the [Sevmorput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevmorput), a container ship and [LASH carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter_aboard_ship)
(Which means it does that thing where it sinks down a bit, a lighter barge goes on top, and it rises back up to carry it.)
It was taken out of service for 10 years in 2007, but after refit, it went back to sea.
Still nuclear, not diesel for once! It outlasted the USSR and it's still running today under a Russian flag.


Anyway, back to nuclear airships though, and later Goodyear apparently wanted to make one, they designed a nuclear blimp in 1963, 
after developing a rubberized fabric that could survive 100 million roentgens of radiation. 
Which is a lot. As the article says, "500 roentgens in five hours is usually lethal."
But all US Navy funding for lighter than air flight stopped shortly after.

And so the battle to develop nuclear heavier-than-air flight built up through the 60s, and that generally didn't really work out.
(All sorts of horrible stuff like trying to build an aviation hydraulics system running on liquid alkali metals.)

But then, as that original article says:
```
In 1973 the Bulgarian newspaper Trud reported that the Soviet Union had plans for a 
943-foot-long nuclear-powered airship capable of carrying 1,800 passengers or 180 tons 
of freight at a cruising speed of 190 mph. The following year, the Associated Press 
published a photo showing an illustration of the Soviet dirigible.
````
(943 feet = 287m, 190mph = 305km/h)
Just... oooooh!
1800 passengers, travelling at 190mph in a nuclear airship!
That's going to catch my interest.

Now, this airship did not come to pass.
That much is a given. (well, maybe. Maybe you assumed a nuclear cruise ship would not exist)
The D-1 airship was unveiled in the end, and it was only 84m long (275ft), it only went at 200km/h (124mph), and it wasn't nuclear.
I've not seen what it ran on in the end, but I wouldn't mind guessing diesel, like the Otto Hahn and Mutsu, nuclear dreams crash down to Earth as diesel.

Well, air travel is hard. I think it will be one of the big problems facing us in the quest to go carbon neutral.
There's no battery powered planes on the horizon and there's [videos on energy density reasons why it isn't possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPqWv-eVIc).
Biofuels don't seem likely to power planes any time soon. Solar aircraft can carry maybe a single passenger.
And they need to scale so dramatically larger that they aren't terribly likely to change that.

So.. how about a nuclear airship? At 190mph, that makes a London to New York flight (8 hours in an airliner), about 18 hours.
This massively ignores headwinds and such, of course! And weather. And probably a few other factors.
1800 passengers, in cruise-ship comfort? That's some incredible step up when the average transatlantic flight has something like 240 people on board.

So then I am wondering, well, airliners give a decent dose of radiation anyway, right?
I've heard that after working in the skies, you're no longer allowed to donate organs, due to radiation damage.
[This does not seem to be true.](https://australianaviation.com.au/2018/10/dispelling-myths-about-aviation-and-organ-donation/)
But the radiation exposure on a flight is certainly above standard background radiation, but not by much.
Turns out, [it's about 0.003mSv/hr](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/air-travel-exposes-you-to-radiation-how-much-health-risk-comes-with-it/) (milliSieverts per hour)

But still, how different would the scale be?
Well, we don't have stats on radiation levels in a nuclear airship, due to the unfortunate fact that none were made.
But we do have [plenty of stats for the NS Savannah!](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4777778)
It seems the maximum radiation exposure for a passenger on the NS Savannah was about 0.0001mrem/hr, which is 0.01mSv/hr.
So that's a bit more, 3 times more.
And the flight is longer.
I'm assuming that the lower altitude of the airship means the atmosphere is still protecting you from the radiation that it doesn't protect from on an airliner flight.

So a London to New York flight via airliner would give a radiation dose of about 0.024mSv.
The same trip in a nuclear airship would be maybe 0.18mSv.

So it's about ten times as much radiation for a nuclear airship flight, vs an airliner flight.

Based on [XKCD's nice radiation dose chart](https://xkcd.com/radiation/), that takes it from a chest x-ray to half a mammogram.
It's still not much, but the EPA wouldn't recommend you do it more than.. 5 or 6 times a year.

Probably not the future. (Though, I'm not sure what the future of commercial flight can be)
