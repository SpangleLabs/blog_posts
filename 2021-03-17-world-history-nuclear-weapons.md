# World timeline of nuclear weapon development

## What isn't covered here
This isn't going to cover delayed criticality (slow burn nuclear fission), or accidental prompt criticality (chernobyl, etc), I'm just going to focus on intentional prompt critical nuclear reactions for this one.

## Inception of an idea
So, in 1940, a couple of German-Jewish physicsts at the University of Birmingham wrote a paper which showed that the amount of fissile material needed to make an atomic bomb was actually very small, and could actually be practically built, and delivered by air.
It wouldn't need to be 40 tonnes, it could be about 600 grams of uranium.
This changed the game a bit from a theoretical to a very practical problem.

## Tube alloys
And so the first project to develop a nuclear bomb began. Codename: Tube Alloys

## Manhattan and Quebec
However, Britain was under a lot of economic strain in the years after 1940, and couldn't fund the project fully. A couple years later the Manhatten Project began in the USA, and so entered the Quebec Agreement. Which merged the Tube Alloys project into the Manhatten Project, with an agreement not to use nukes on eachother, and to share the results of the project at the end of the war.

## The device, Trinity, and Potsdam
The war proceeded, development continued, and the first device was detonated in the New Mexico desert, Trinity. President Truman and Winston Churchill teased mention of it at the Potsdam conference. Telling Stalin they had developed "a new weapon of unusual destructive force". He said he was glad, but showed no special interest. Truman later said how delighted he was that Stalin had no idea what he was talking about.

## The Soviet program
Stalin left the conference that night and returned to his room, where he issued orders to the NKVD to speed up the work on the soviet nuclear program. He had a good poker face. Klaus Fuchs had been feeding back information from deep within the Manhatten Project, though Stalin was surprised at the speed with which the USA was already testing their first nuclear device.

## Use in anger
And so, the US tested their second bomb, a different design to the first, over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Somewhere around 100,000 people were killed, mostly civilians. The second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki days later. It was the same design as Trinity and it was ready and waiting in case the first failed to detonate, to destroy the evidence before it could be reverse-engineered by Japan. 

Japanese scientists were urged by the military to try and build their own device, and rather firmly told that would be very very impossible with the resources and timescales left. Japan surrendered not long after.

## The war ends, the nightmare begins
And so the war ended, and the nightmare of nuclear proliferation only just begins.
The Quebec Agreement was then modified, no longer was consent required from all three states before nuclear weapons could be used, and suddenly the USA had no interest in sharing their nuclear technology or materials with the UK. Legislation (the McMahon Act) was soon passed in the USA making it illegal to share nuclear secrets with any other nation. The UK was left in the dark, pulled their nuclear scientists back, and told them to write down everything they could remember from the Manhatten Project.

## Player two
A couple years pass and the second nuclear state was born. In 1949 the Special Jet Engine program reached its climax as the USSR detonated their first nuclear device.

## Playing catch-up
The UK was left playing catch-up, and planned to detonate their first device in Scotland, before deciding the damp weather would risk shorting the electronics, and detonating their first atomic weapon in Australia in 1952.

## 20 questions, 4 nuclear states
France was the fourth to try and get a nuke. They had also contributed scientists to the Manhatten Project, but after the McMahon Act, American scientists were forbidden from telling them how to build a nuclear device. However, the US government wanted to help anyway, thinking that having multiple western nuclear powers would deter the USSR, and so sent over scientists who could never tell French scientists what to do, or what works. But could tell them what doesn't work.
"Do we do X?"
"Nope, that does not work."
"How about Y?"
"I can't comment on that"
And so France detonated their first nuclear weapon in 1960 in Algeria. A pattern of using colonies is developing.

## Not the only ones to make agreements
Of course, the USSR had also made agreements. A trade deal was struck with China that China would provide uranium ore, and the USSR would provide technical help in developing a device. Mao said at a meeting of the politburo, “In today's world, if we don't want to be bullied, we have to have this thing.” They detonated their first nuclear weapon in 1964

## Non-proliferation
This started to be worrying, and so the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was created, which prohibits nations with nuclear technology sharing it with nations who do not. These five nations signed up, and many others did too. There are only 3 nations which never accepted it, India, Pakistan, and Israel.

## Post-colonial security
And so the next public nuclear state entered the stage. India tested their first "peaceful nuclear explosive" in 1974, Smiling Buddha. This was the first nuclear test after NPT, and it made some people angry. Though India argued that the NPT just splits the world into pre-defined nuclear "haves", and "have nots", and that it denies security to post-colonial states.

South Africa followed sometime in the 1980s, building six nuclear weapons but never testing one. In the 1990s they then decided this was a mistake, and dismantled their weapons.

## Collapse and agreements
The early 1990s also saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with that, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine inherited a large amount of nuclear weapons. Ukraine became the third largest nuclear power on Earth, with up to 3000 warheads. Belarus and Kazakhstan transferred their nuclear weapons to Russia, but Ukraine came to a different result. The Budapest memorandum was created. It agrees that Ukraine will dismantle their nuclear arsenal, and in exchange the UK, USA, and Russia will defend them if their borders are ever disrepected. This.. doesn't seem to have stood the test of time. It turns out that once you don't have nuclear weapons, there's no big incentive to defend you against nuclear states. This is a problem for non-proliferation.

## Proliferation
Pakistan became the next nuclear state, having been developing them for a few decades, they detonated their first five nuclear tests in 1998, in response to five new tests by India. It's believed they had them for a couple decades already and had been practicing deliberate ambiguity.

One nation who did sign NPT was North Korea, but they then announced in 2003 that they would be pulling out of the agreement, as the US was accusing them of having a nuclear program. They detonated their first nuclear weapon in 2006.. It's widely believed Pakistan helped them in this effort. Pakistan has admitted that North Korea gained access to their technology in the 1990s.

## Deliberate ambiguity
The last nation in the list of non-signatories to NPT is Israel. They've never tested a nuclear weapon, and never officially admitted to having them. Although there was an incident in 1979 in the Indian Ocean which some believe could have been a joint Israel-South African nuclear test. They do however like to hint at their existence, and have told hostile neighbouring states that they would retaliate heavily if threatened.

And that’s all the nuclear powers so far, though Iran has repeatedly been hitting headlines with attempts to enrich uranium and potentially build a device. With efforts famously thwarted so far by impressive malware. Syria has also hit headlines once or twice, and had reactors destroyed by e-war and airstrikes. Similarly Saudi Arabia has reported signed deals to help fund Pakistan's nuclear program, in exchange for warheads should the need arise.

## 13,400 warheads
And that’s where we are now.

There are 13,000 warheads left in the world. 2,000 tests have been done.
And there are 9 nuclear powers, 5 with global range, and 4 with regional range.

We just have to hope no one blinks first.
